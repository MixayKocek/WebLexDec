This is a very simple, quick-and-dirty app for doing lexical decision tasks via
Internet. Works in modern Firefox and Chrome browsers.

Long story short:
- You can have different test sets ("styles"). There are two here: simp and trad.
- For each style, you provide a list of primes followed by target items, in a file named
  <style>.js
- To run the app point the browser to index.php?style=<style>&id=<id> where <style> is
  the style you want to use, and <id> is an id of the current test subject (you have to
  generate it yourself)
- The results are saved in /tmp/<id>_test (for the test runs) and /tmp/<id>
- You can group the prime-target pairs, and analyse them using analyse.rb (the output is:
  type interval answer)
- If you modify wld.coffee, you have to regenerate wld.js (running make should be enough)
